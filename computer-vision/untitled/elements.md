# Elements

## Playbin

[playbin](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/playback/playbin.html?gi-language=python#playbin) is a special element which acts as a source and as a sink, and is a whole pipeline. Internally, it creates and connects all the necessary elements to play your media, so you do not have to worry about it.
